# Mobile Action Assessment

Mobile Action helps their customers to achieve their goals in terms of increased impressions, increased download through Apple Search Ads Optimization. To make an analogy, Mobile Action is like what is SEMRush for SEO but for Apple Search. They enable their customers to more effectively use their marketing budget by gathering data about search keywords and let them pick keywords that has high value to price.

Mobile Action helps their customers in several ways; 

App Intelligence, to find detailed information about applications in App Store
ASO Intelligence, where customers can optimize their apps in App Store through keyword insights 
Market Intelligence, where customers can find crucial App Store market information
Ad Intelligence, to get information about other advertisements and their metrics
SDK Intelligence, to see which apps use which software development kits

All kinds of customers who has an app on the AppStore and want to increase their downloads could utilise Mobile Action; however, I think that small to medium sized companies which have limited budget would be a great buyer for Mobile Action, as they want to maximize their value per dollar and they have much more limited and less budget compared to bigger rivals. 

Another buyer for the Mobile Action's products could be the digital marketing agencies/freelancers who gives assistance to app owners. They can buy the enterprise package and sell the information they gathered. 

The general users of the product would be from marketing department, to optimize the advertisements and app store pages better. However, I can see that as it gives also information about the market trends, and popular keywords, it could be utilised for the product managers, who decide which applications to be produced. As it gives information about SDK's, game developers also can utilise the products of Mobile Action. If the company has data analysts, they can also use the data gathered to make reports and forecasts. Also everyone who is interested in the digital marketing area could utilise the resources provided such as webinars or growth university.
