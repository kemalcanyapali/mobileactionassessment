Task 2

I am an Apple Search Ads(ASA) expert, and I do ad optimizations to increase downloads for our applications. I make sure that we get the best result for our spending on advertisements. 

In my job, I routinely do keyword exploring, through adding our exact match keywords as negative keywords to our search match campaign and exploring new ones as they occur, and adding them to our negative keyword list in that campaign if they will be helpful. Check for daily recommendations from apple search ads such as keyword recommendations and budget recommendations to reach the possible customers we can not reach currently. Compare different ad groups and see what is working and what is not, then make changes accordingly to increase the ad performance. 

Task 3

Dear Manager,

Mobile Action is one of Apple Search's trusted partners, and we have been using Mobile Action's free package for some time. We have seen significant results while using it, such as decreasing our CPT(cost-per-tap) while increasing our downloads. However, to increase our capacity for keywords and competitor analysis and further optimize our advertising campaigns, it would be better for us to upgrade our plan. Also, it would be better for our ASO team; Mobile Action also provides useful information about Apple Search Optimization, such as ASO reports and suggestions.

There are two plans; Startup for 49$/mo and Growth 299$/mo, which adds more functionality to our current plan. You can find a detailed comparison of plans at https://www.mobileaction.co/pricing/. We can start with the Startup package and upgrade our package when it is not enough. On the other hand, if you are comfortable with using Mobile Action, I can schedule a demo for us and talk to the agents there and find the most suitable package for us. 

Best Regards,
Kemalcan Yapali
